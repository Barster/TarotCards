Tarot Card Autoplayer

This is an autoplayer for a game called Tarot Cards. It is exactly like pairs, with the addition of questions that must be answered on each level in order to proceed. The game uses AMF to communicate to and from the server, so I have written my own conversion methods to replicate it (Crypt.java).
